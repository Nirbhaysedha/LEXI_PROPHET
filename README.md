## Overview

The IntelliSense Next-Word Prediction Model is a machine learning project designed to provide intelligent text suggestions in the style of Visual Studio Code's IntelliSense. This model predicts the next word or token a user is likely to enter based on the input context. It can be seamlessly integrated into applications requiring text autocompletion or next-word prediction.
