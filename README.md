## Model Architecture


Next-Word Prediction Model is built on a deep learning architecture that includes:

- **Embedding Layer:** Converts tokens into dense vectors.
- **LSTM Layers:** Captures sequential patterns in the input.
- **Dense Layer:** Predicts the next token.
- **Softmax Activation:** Converts model outputs into token probabilities.

You can fine-tune hyperparameters and the model's architecture in the code to suit your specific requirements.

## Data Preparation

To train and use the model effectively, prepare your dataset with the following steps:

- **Tokenization:** Convert text or code snippets into tokens or words.
- **Padding:** Ensure all input sequences have the same length.
- **Vocabulary:** Create a vocabulary mapping tokens to numeric IDs.
- **Train/Test Split:** Divide your dataset into training and testing sets.

You can utilize libraries like TensorFlow Tokenizer or custom tokenization methods to accomplish these tasks.

## Evaluation

Evaluate your model's performance using appropriate metrics, such as accuracy, perplexity, or BLEU score for code autocompletion or text generation tasks. Implement evaluation scripts and apply them to a validation dataset or a separate test dataset.

## Customization

Feel free to customize this model to meet your specific needs. You can experiment with hyperparameters, model architecture, and pre-trained embeddings to enhance performance for your particular application.
